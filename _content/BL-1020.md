## What is IAM

IAM is a service that helps securely control access to AWS resources. You can use it to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups (to support authentication). You can also use IAM for permissions to allow or deny their access to AWS resources (to support authorization).

- **Authentication**

Use IAM to configure authentication, which is the first step because it controls who can access AWS resources. IAM is used for user authentication, and applications and other AWS services also use it for access.

- **Authorization**

IAM is used to configure authorization based on the user. Authorization determines which resources users can access and what they can do to or with those resources.
Authorization is defined through the use of policies. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions.
