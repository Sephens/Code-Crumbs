Abstract: In the world of cloud computing, managing network resources efficiently is crucial for ensuring high availability, scalability, and reliability. One such resource in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the Elastic IP address. Elastic IPs play a vital role in managing public IP addresses for your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and more. This article will provide an in-depth exploration of AWS Elastic IPs, including their features, use cases, benefits, and step-by-step examples.

## Create Subnets and Allocate IP addresses in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

### Objectives
In this article, you will:

* Summarize the customer scenario
* Create a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and understand how to create subnets and allocate IP addresses
* Familiarize yourself with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Management Console
* Develop a solution to the customer's issue in this lab
* Summarize and describe your findings (group activity)


Ticket from your customer
Hello, Cloud Support!

I'm new to AWS, and I need help setting up a VPC. Can you please help me through the setup process? I would like to build only the VPC part and would like to make it look something like the following picture. Can you help me ensure  I have around 15,000 private IP addresses in this VPC available?  I would also like the VPC IPv4 CIDR block to be a 192.x.x.x. I don't remember which is a private range though. Can you confirm that? I would also like to allocate at least 50 IP addresses for the public subnet.

Thanks!
Paulo Santos
Startup Owner

## What is a VPC
A VPC is like a data center but in the cloud. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks, and you can use a VPC to spin up and launch your AWS resources within minutes.
Resources within a VPC communicate with each other through private IP addresses. An instance needs a public IP address for it to communicate outside the VPC. The VPC needs networking resources, such as an internet gateway and a route table, for the instance to reach the internet.
A CIDR block is a range of private IP addresses that is used within the VPC (for example, the /16 number that you see next to an IP address).
A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your VPC.

## Step by step into launching and configuring VPC

### Step One Launching a VPC

 1. In the AWS console, type and search for VPC in the search bar on the top-left corner. Select VPC from the list. Alternatively, You can also find VPC under Services - Networking & Content Delivery in the top left corner

You are now in the Amazon VPC dashboard. You use the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service to build your VPC.

2. Choose the Create VPC button to launch your first VPC. This will launch you into a step by step process to set up a VPC with it's basic components.

You can configure the following in order to lauch your VPC
Configure the following options:

* IPv6 CIDR block
* VPC name
* Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR
* Availability Zone
* Subnet name
