## Introduction
In today’s cloud-first world, security is non-negotiable. Amazon Inspector is AWS’s automated security assessment service designed to help businesses identify vulnerabilities in their cloud environments. Whether you’re a DevOps engineer, a security specialist, or an AWS user, understanding Amazon Inspector is key to maintaining compliance and reducing risks. This guide explores its features, use cases, best practices, and how it stacks up against competitors.

### **1. What is Amazon Inspector?**  
Amazon Inspector is a **fully managed vulnerability assessment service** that automatically scans AWS workloads (EC2 instances, containers, Lambda functions, etc.) for security vulnerabilities, unintended exposures, and deviations from best practices. It uses machine learning (ML) and AWS threat intelligence to prioritize risks.  

### **2. Key Features and Capabilities**  
- **Automated Scanning**: Continuously monitors EC2 instances, ECR container images, and serverless Lambda functions.  
- **CVE Detection**: Identifies Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) like log4j, Heartbleed, and Shellshock.  
- **Network Reachability Analysis**: Checks if vulnerabilities are exploitable via public/internet access.  
- **Integration with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with AWS Security Hub, Amazon EventBridge, and AWS Systems Manager.  
- **Agentless Scanning (New in 2023)**: Scans EC2 instances without installing agents.
