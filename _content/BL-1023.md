## Introduction

As part of your day-to-day administrative task in maintaining your workloads, you want to be able to effectively manage your resources, such as patching, performing updates, and automating tasks.

## What is AWS Systems Manager? 🍊

AWS Systems Manager is a service that enables you to centrally manage yout AWS resources. You have the visibility of your resources across AWS services and you can perform configuration management, and automate day-to-day operational tasks.

The service utilizes the concept of documents(JSON and YAML), which define the actions that systems Manager performs on your managed resources such as operational management, change management, application management, and node management.

The documents can be pre-deined(e.g the AWS-CreateRdsSnapshot document that can be used to create RDS snapshot for an RDS instance.) or customized by the user.

## What can you do with AWS Systems Manager?

### 1. Run Command
With the run command, you are able to Keep your instances in a consistent state by enforcing security policies, firewall rules, and system settings automatically.

### 2. State Manager
With state manager, you are able to configure a predefined state that can be used to maintain consistency in your configurations across a fleet of instances, such as firewall configurations, and antivirus configurations.

### 3. Inventory
The inventory capability of AWS systems manager enables you to track applications, files, system configurations, and patches across your managed instances for better visibility and compliance.

### 4. Maintenance Window
This service enables you to Schedule maintenance tasks (like patching or updates) during specific time windows so as not to disrupt normal business hours.

### 5. Patch Manager
Automatically scan, approve, and install patches on your EC2 instances for improved security and compliance.

### 6. Automation
This enables you to automate various maintenance tasks, such as updating AMIs(Amazon Machine Images), creating snapshots of EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes, resetting passwords, and launching or terminating EC2 instances.

### 7. Distributor
With Distributor, you can easily package, distribute, and update applications across multiple instances with seamless version control.
You can as well reinstall new package versions and perform in-place updates

### 8. Session Manager
With Session Manager, you are able to remotely  access your EC2 instances using a browser-based shell or the CLI. It provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbond ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manager SSH keys.

### 9. Incident Manager
This capability enables you to manage and resolve incident affecting AWS-hosted applications. It offers a management console to track all your incidents and notify responders of impact, identify data that can help with troubleshooting, and help you get services back up and running

### 10. Parameter Store
Store and securely manage sensitive information like passwords and database connection strings, with encryption and access control.

## Patch Management

Among the many things you can do with AWS Systems Manager, I would like to pick on Patch Management. Let us look at how you can automate patches in Linux and Windows instances with a practical Scenario.

In organizations with hundreds and often thousands of workstations, it can be logistically challenging to keep all the operating system (OS) and application software up to date. In most cases, OS updates on workstations can be automatically applied via the network. However, administrators must have a clear security policy and baseline plan to ensure that all workstations are running a certain minimum version of software.

Assuming you have a fleet of Linux and Windows Instance, In this simple exercise, we shall:
- Patch Linux instances using default baseline
- Create custom patch baseline 
- Use patch groups to to patch Windows instances using custom patch baseline 
- Verify patch compliance

## 1. Patch Linux instances using default baselines
In this task, you patch Linux EC2 instances using default baselines available for the OS.

>Patch Manager provides predefined patch baselines for each of the operating systems that it supports. You can use these baselines as they are currently configured (you can't customize them), or you can create your own custom patch baselines. You can use custom patch baselines for greater control over which patches are approved or rejected for your environment.

Steps:

1. In the AWS Management Console, in the search  box, enter `Systems Manager` and select it. This option takes you to the Systems Manager console page.

2. In the left navigation pane, under Node Tools, choose Fleet Manager.

In my case I have some pre-configured EC2 instances. There are three Linux instances and three Windows instances. These EC2 instances have a specific IAM role associated with them that allows you you managed them using Systems Manager, which is why you can view them in the Fleet Manager section.
