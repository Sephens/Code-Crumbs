## Introduction
Management and monitoring the resources on AWS is important. It helps in making sure that applications perform as expected, they are running in the most cost-efficient manner, secure and highly available.

You would also want to monitor the consumption of your application, and identify technicalities that may affect performance and availability.

As a management routine, you also need to be able  to audit your environment, with access to information such as access patterns, and identify anomalies that may indicate potential performance or security issues.

## What is Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch is a service that enables you to monitor your AWS resources and applications, running on AWS as well as on-premises in `real time.`

With CloudWatch, you can also collect resource and application metrics, logs, and events. These data can therefore help in analysis and identify trends.

CloudWatch can also be used to configure `Alarms` that monitors metrics. If the metrics breaches certain thresholdsfor a specified period, an alarm is generated on which action can be taken to remediate.

The metrics can be either built-in or customed. Metrics exist in the region in which they are created, but you can also configure cross-account cross-region dashboards in order to gain visibility of those metrics,logs and alarms.


## Amazon CloudWatch Use Cases
1. **Infrastructure monitoring and troubleshooting**- With key metrics that can be collected, potential issues and bottlenecks can be identified. A root analysis can be conducted based on the data and resolution can be made.

2. **Proactive resource optimization** - With alarms, metric values can be monitored and triggers can be set if breaches occur. An automatic remediation action can be defined for instance configuring auto-scaling, and terminating failed instances. When such happen a notification can be sent to admistrators and system operators.

3. **Log analytics** - With the help of metrics and logs, the information obtained can be used to address operational issues, potential security attacks, or application performance issues, and take effective actions to remediate.

## Dashboards
Dashboards are created on Amazon CloudWatch to allow visualization  and monitoring of resources and the metrics that are essential. They are configured to provide insights on resources' health across AWS accounts and Regions

This is an example of AWS CloudWatch Dashboared:
